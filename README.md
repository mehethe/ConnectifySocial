# Connectify

This project aims to develop a real-time social networking application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), along with Socket.IO and WebRTC for real-time communication. The application provides a platform for users to connect with friends, send real-time notifications, chat, create room, make audio/video calls, and share their screens.

## Key Features:

### User Authentication and Authorization:

- Signing up and logging in with email along with email verification.
- Forgot and reset password features for enhanced user account security.
- Firebase Authentication for secure user authentication, including login with Google.
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for managing user sessions and authorization.

### Friend Management:

- Users can search people, send friend requests, accept or decline requests, create rooms, and manage their friend list.

### Real-Time Notifications:

- Users receive real-time notifications for friend requests, messages, and calls.

### Chat:

- Users can send and receive real-time messages with their friends

### Audio/Video Calls:

- Users can make and receive audio and video calls in real-time

### Screen Sharing:

- During a call, users can share their screens with others

### Responsive Design:

- The application will have a responsive design that works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

### Dark and Light Mode:

- Automatically detects the user's system theme preference (light or dark mode).
- Provides users with a manual toggle option to switch between light and dark modes regardless of the system theme.

## Tech Stack:

- **Frontend:** React.js, Tailwind CSS, Zustand, TanStack Query, Axios.
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, Socket.IO, MongoDB, Mongoose, Firebase Authentication, JSON Web Tokens (JWT), Nodemailer.
- **Additional Services:** WebRTC.

## Live Demo:

- [https://connectify-social.onrender.com](https://connectify-social.onrender.com)
- Render spins down free web services when they become inactive for a while, and spinning them up again upon a request may take **up to 50 seconds. Please be patient upon the first load.**
